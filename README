This is the Goplayer source tree.  Goplayer is a Flash-based video
player with a strong focus on code quality.  The top-level directories
and files are described below.

asautotest.sh
  Helper script for invoking ASAutotest in a way appropriate for
  hacking on the player engine.  Start here if you want to work with
  the player engine code.

bin/
  The web framework used for demoing and debugging the player.
  Before running goplayer.html, you need to create goplayer.swf,
  preferably using the asautotest.sh script.

src/
  The source code for the player engine.

skin-interface/
  The interfaces used for player-skin-communication.

skins/
  Skin FLA files and any skin-specific code.  Start here if you only
  want to work with skins.

skin-src/
  Low-level, generic skin code.  When creating a new skin, you may
  want to inherit from one of the abstract base classes here.

lib/
  Generic utility functions and classes, used in both the player
  engine code and the skin code.
